## 1. Acrylic Tube, Flat Bar and 3D Printed Inserts -- 30m
### PARTS
1. 2" (50mm) outside diameter Acrylic Tube x 24" long
2. 3D Printed top/bottom inserts
3. 2x -- M4 x 55mm Philips Head Bolt
4. 2x -- M4 hex nuts
5. 1/2" x 1/8" Aluminum Flat bar at least 24" long

### TOOLS
<!-- * **3/16" PlastiDrill Bit** for 10-32 Main Mounting Bolt Holes in Acrylic Tube -->
* **3D Printed Hole Placement Jig**
* **Fine Tip Sharpie**
* **5/32" or M4 PlastiDrill Bit** for M4 Main Mounting Bolt Holes in Acrylic Tube
* **3/16" Regular Drill Bit** for hole in Flat Bar and D-rings
* **Phillips Screw Driver**

### BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
1. Slide the Acrylic Tube Hole Placement Jig snugly over one end of the acrylic tube. Make sure there are no gaps between the tube and the seat of the jig
2. Using a fine tip sharpie, mark the placements for the mounting bolt holes 
3. Remove the Jig and use the 5/32" or M4 PlastiDrill Bit to drill the holes in the acrylic tube
4. Place one of the 3D Printed inserts into the tube and make sure the M4 bolt goes all the way through
5. Measure 12mm from one end of the Flat Bar and make a mark halfway between the outer edges. Then make a second mark 10mm below that (this mark will be used in step 2)
6. Use the 3/16" Regular Drill Bit to drill a hole in the middle of the flat bar at the 12mm mark
7. With the 3D Printed insert still seated in the tube, slide the flat bar in the slot of the insert so that the hole in the flatbar aligns with the holes for the insert. **IMPORTANT:** Make sure not to knick the insides of the acrylic tube when sliding the flatbar into it. 
8. Secure the insert and flat bar in place with the M4 bolt and nut. Don't tighten too tight.
9. Flip the Acrylic tube over and slide the Hole Placement Jig on the other end of the tube, making sure the Flat Bar slots into the opening in the center of the jig. Again make sure there are no gaps between the tube and the seat of the jig.
10. Twist the jig slightly to make it so the flat bar doesn't jiggle if the tube is shaken. This will make the flat bar twist ever so slightly from one end of the tube to the other. This is necessary to prevent it from rattling.
11. Mark the hole placements for the mounting bolt on the outside of the acrylic tube and on the flat bar
12. Remove the jig, the mounting bolt and insert on the other end and pull out the flat bar. Again make sure not to scrape the insides of the acrylic tube.
13. Make a second mark 10mm below the one that was just made on the flat bar (this mark will be used in step 2)
14. Use the 5/32" or M4 PlastiDrill Bit to drill the holes in the acrylic tube
15. Use the 3/16" Regular Drill Bit to drill a hole in the flat bar at the mark
16. Now place both 3D printed inserts into the ends of the tube and slide the flat bar back into place. Test to make sure the M4 bolts are able to secure the inserts and flat bar on both ends of the tube.

## 5. PCB3 and Handle assembly -- 20m
### PARTS
1. Acrylic Tube with LEDs Assembly and M4 x 55mm bolt from Step 4
2. 1x -- M4 Hex Nut
3. D-Ring
4. M4 x 55mm Bolt 
5. 3x -- M4 x 16mm bolts from step 3
6. PCB3
   1. 1x - Molex Vertical Male with BMI
7. 3x - No6 x 1/4" thread cutting screws


### TOOLS
* **Phillips Screw Driver**
* **Locktight or threadlocker (if using it on the screws)**
* **M4 Screw Driver with long extension**
* **Soldering Iron**

### BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
1. Thread the 2 conductor wire coming off PCB2 through the wire passthrough hole in the handle
2. Lightly tug on the wire and move the handle and acrylic tube closer together
3. Once they are nearly touching, seat the M4 Hex nut into the nut holder of the handle and slide the handle over the bottom insert and acrylic tube. press the parts together slowly, pulling on the wire as necessary so it doesn't bunch up on the inside next to PCB2
4. Once the two parts are seated together, put the D-Ring in its place and screw the M4 x 55mm bolt back through the D-Ring, and then screw all the way in until it's just starting to get tight. Back off a few turns so it's not engaged at all.
5. Now put a small amount of the locktight/threadlocker on one of the M4 x 16mm screws and screw it most of the way down. repeat this step with the other 2 screws
6. Once all screws are in place, give a couple more turns to each to make sure the assembly is snug
7. Finally gently tighten the M4 x 55mm bolt. It just needs to engage a few threads as it's likely pretty well stuck in place by all the components it is going through. Overtightening could crack the acrylic tube.
8. Now assemble PCB3 and cut the 2 conductor wire coming out of the end of the handle to a length that is just barely protruding from the end. It will have to feed back into the handle once soldered to PCB3
9. Strip the ends of the wires and solder them into their place on the backside of PCB3
10. Secure PCB3 in place with the No6 x 1/4" thread cutting screws
