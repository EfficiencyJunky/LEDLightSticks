## STEP 1
### Acrylic Tube, Flat Bar and 3D Printed Inserts
#### Estimated Build Time: 30 minutes
### PARTS
1. 2" (50mm) outside diameter Acrylic Tube x 24" long
2. 3D Printed top/bottom inserts
   -- [TOP Insert 3D Model](https://github.com/EfficiencyJunky/LEDLightSticks/blob/main/ENCLOSURE/3D_MODELS/V2p2/Lights_M4/STEP1-Inserts/V2p2--M4--Insert_top_133.stl)
   -- [BOTTOM Insert 3D Model](https://github.com/EfficiencyJunky/LEDLightSticks/blob/main/ENCLOSURE/3D_MODELS/V2p2/Lights_M4/STEP1-Inserts/V2p2--M4--Insert_bottom_133.stl)
4. 2x -- M4 x 55mm Philips Head Bolt
5. 2x -- M4 hex nuts
6. 1/2" x 1/8" Aluminum Flat bar at least 24" long

### TOOLS
<!-- * **3/16" PlastiDrill Bit** for 10-32 Main Mounting Bolt Holes in Acrylic Tube -->
* **3D Printed Hole Placement Jig** -- [Jig 3D Model](https://github.com/EfficiencyJunky/LEDLightSticks/blob/main/ENCLOSURE/3D_MODELS/V2p2/Lights_M4/STEP0-Jig/V2p2--Jig_123.stl)
* **Fine Tip Sharpie**
* **5/32" or M4 PlastiDrill Bit** for M4 Main Mounting Bolt Holes in Acrylic Tube
* **3/16" Regular Drill Bit** for hole in Flat Bar and D-rings
* **Phillips Screw Driver**

### BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
1. Slide the Acrylic Tube Hole Placement Jig snugly over one end of the acrylic tube. Make sure there are no gaps between the tube and the seat of the jig
2. Using a fine tip sharpie, mark the placements for the mounting bolt holes 
3. Remove the Jig and use the 5/32" or M4 PlastiDrill Bit to drill the holes in the acrylic tube. Be careful not to allow the bit to creep. You may want to use a tiny drill bit (like a 1/16" bit) to drill an initial pilot hole where the sharpie mark was made, which will allow the tip of the 5/32" plasti-drill bit to seat in that hole when drilling the final hole. Also try to make sure the drill is perpendicular to the tube so that the hole goes in straight.
4. Place one of the 3D Printed inserts into the tube and make sure the M4 bolt goes all the way through. Also make sure that the top of the insert is relatively flush with the top of the acrylic tube. ideally there is less than 0.5mm of protrusion.
5. Measure 12mm from one end of the Flat Bar and make a mark halfway between the outer edges. Then make a second mark 10mm below that (this mark will be used in step 2)
6. Use the 3/16" Regular Drill Bit to drill a hole in the middle of the flat bar at the 12mm mark. it's ok for this hole if it isn't perfectly centered on the flat bar but it should be as close as possible
7. With the 3D Printed insert still seated in the tube, slide the flat bar in the slot of the insert so that the hole in the flatbar aligns with the holes for the insert. **IMPORTANT:** Make sure not to knick the insides of the acrylic tube when sliding the flatbar into it. 
8. Secure the insert and flat bar in place with the M4 bolt and nut. Don't tighten too tight.
9. Flip the Acrylic tube over and slide the Hole Placement Jig on the other end of the tube, making sure the Flat Bar slots into the opening in the center of the jig. Again make sure there are no gaps between the tube and the seat of the jig.
10. Twist the jig slightly to make it so the flat bar doesn't jiggle if the tube is shaken. This will make the flat bar twist ever so slightly from one end of the tube to the other. This is necessary to prevent it from rattling.
11. Mark the hole placements for the mounting bolt on the outside of the acrylic tube
12. Mark the hole placement on the flat bar by drawing a vertical line using the slot in the hole placement jig. The bottom of the line will be where the second hole in the flat bar will go.
13. Remove the jig, the mounting bolt and insert on the other end and pull out the flat bar. Again make sure not to scrape the insides of the acrylic tube.
14. Make a second mark 10mm below the bottom of the line that was just made on the flat bar (this mark will be used in step 2)
15. Use the 5/32" or M4 PlastiDrill Bit to drill the holes in the acrylic tube
16. Use the 3/16" Regular Drill Bit to drill a hole in the flat bar at the mark
17. Now place both 3D printed inserts into the ends of the tube and slide the flat bar back into place. Test to make sure the M4 bolts are able to secure the inserts and flat bar on both ends of the tube.

6. Permanent double sided tape
7. 2x -- 2.5mm wide zip ties
8. [Foam Wrap](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PBKLOM) -- 57cm length (width is determined by the roll itself)


### TOOLS
* **Wire Stripper**
* **Soldering Iron**
* **Heat Gun (for heat shrink)**
* **Scisors**
* **Clear packaging tape**


### BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
1. Cut the JST-XHx3 cable assembly wires to 8.5 cm from where they come out of the back of the JST Connector
2. Strip around 5mm of casing off of each of the wires
3. Tin the ends of the wires
4. Tin the pads on the ends of the LED strips with the arrow pointing away from the pads
5. Place a piece of heat shrink over the wires of the assembly and slide down to the JST connector to keep out of the way
6. Solder the 3 wires on each cable assembly to the LED strip. Make sure that Blue is Ground, Green is Data, and Yellow is 5V
7. Slide the Heat shrink over the connections and use the heat gun to shrink it around them
8. Cut the JST-XHx2 cable assembly wires to 4.5 cm from where they come out of the back of the JST Connector cable assembly
9. Strip around 5mm of casing off of the wires
10. Tin the ends of the wires and the pads on the LED strip
11. Place a piece of heat shrink over the wires of the assembly and slide down to the JST connector to keep out of the way
12. Solder the 2 wires on each cable assembly to the LED strip. Make sure the Black wire is ground and red wire is 5V
13. Slide the Heat shrink over the connections and use the heat gun to shrink it around them
14. Now apply a strip of double sided tape to one side of the flat bar between the two mounting holes but don't cover the holes.
15. Place one of the LED strips on the flat bar with equal distance from each end to each mounting hole. (the two second marks you made on the aluminum bar in STEP 1 should roughly be where the ends of the LED strip land. Roughly 10mm from the center of the mounting holes in the flat bar)
16. Flip the flat bar over and repeat steps 12 and 13 with the other strip. Make sure that the JST connector assemblies on the LED strips match on each end and that the LEDs on either side of the flat bar are lined up with eachother. smooth out any kinks in the LED strips so they are as flat as possible on the flat bar.
17. Now place the foam wrap flat on a table or other flat surface. Place the flat bar on the edge of the foam wrap and roll it up as tightly as possible in the foam wrap.
18. Secure the foam wrap in place with one long strip of packaging tape. Take care not to get any bubbles or creases in the tape.

### BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
1. Press the M4 Thin Square Nuts into their seats in the Bottom Insert
2. Test that they are seated correctly by screwing the M4 bolts into the nuts but make sure not to screw in more than 3 or 4 threads worth. otherwise the screw will pierce through the 3D printed insert.
3. Once all nuts are verified to be seated correctly, remove all of the bolts and set aside for later
4.  Solder the JST connectors to PCB2
5.  Strip 5mm of casing off one end of the 2 conductor x 20 cm wire
6.  Stick the wire ends into the holes labeled 5V and GND from the same side of PCB2 as the JST connectors. Solder them in place.
7.  Place the M3 lock nuts into their seats in the Bottom Insert and secure PCB2 in place with the 8mm long M3 screws
8. Strip 5mm of casing off one end of the 2 conductor x 3cm wire
9. Tin the ends of the wire
10. Slide the heat shrink over the ends of the wire and far enough away from the ends that the heat shrink won't activate when soldering
11. Solder the wires to the contacts on the rocker switch. The color of the wires doesn't matter
12. Push the heat shrink over the soldered connections and shrink with heat gun
13. Strip 5mm of casing off the other end of the wires that are now attached to the rocker switch
14. Slide the rocker switch into its seat in the bottom insert and snap snugly into place
15. Now stick the ends of the wires into the holes on PCB2 labeled "switch" and carefully solder them into place, making sure not to melt the bottom insert. If you are worried about melting, detach PCB2 from the bottom insert and solder the wires, then re-attach PCB2.

6. 2x - M4 Nuts

### TOOLS
* **Phillips Screw Driver**


### BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
1. Check to make sure there is no dust or particles attached to the inside of the acrylic tube. If there is, run a microfiber cloth through the tube from one end to the other to remove the particles.
2. Check to make sure there is no dust or debris trapped in the tape of the Flat Bar/LED assembly
3. Slide the Flat Bar/LED assembly into the tube making sure not to scrape the sides of the tube with the flatbar.
4. Connect the 2 Pin JST connectors to PCB2 **!!! IMPORTANT !!! -- Make sure that the colors of the wires on the JST connectors correspond correctly to the labels on PCB2 for the R/A JST Headers. If they are incorrect, you will need to carefully remove the pins from the JST cable assembly connectors and swap them**
5. Slide the bottom insert into the end of the tube and make sure the flat bar is carefully seated in the slot in the bottom insert
6. Secure the acrylic tube, bottom insert, and flat bar with the mounting bolt. Make sure not to stab the wires with the mounting bolt. If the wires are in the way of the hole in the flat bar, you may have to remove the bottom insert, detatch the wires and bend them to make sure they are out of the way of the hole in the flat bar before putting the bottom insert into the tube.
7. Once everything is in place, flip the tube over and place the bottom insert into the other end of the tube. Make sure the 3 Pin JST assemblies are strung through the correct hole of the insert.
8. Secure the acrylic tube, top insert, and flat bar with the mounting bolt. Again be careful not to stab the wires of the JST assembly.

## STEP 5
### PCB3 and Handle assembly
#### Estimated Build Time: 20 minutes

### PARTS
1. 3D Printed Handle -- [Handle 3D Model](https://github.com/EfficiencyJunky/LEDLightSticks/blob/main/ENCLOSURE/3D_MODELS/V2p2/Lights_M4/STEP2-Handle/V2p2--M4--handle_135.stl)
2. Acrylic Tube with LEDs Assembly and M4 x 55mm bolt from Step 4
3. 1x -- M4 Hex Nut
4. D-Ring
5. M4 x 55mm Bolt 
6. 3x -- M4 x 16mm bolts from step 3
7. PCB3
   1. 1x - Molex Vertical Male with BMI
8. 3x - No6 x 1/4" thread cutting screws


### TOOLS
* **Phillips Screw Driver**
* **Locktight or threadlocker (if using it on the screws)**
* **M4 Screw Driver with long extension**
* **Soldering Iron**

### BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
1. Thread the 2 conductor wire coming off PCB2 through the wire passthrough hole in the handle
2. Lightly tug on the wire and move the handle and acrylic tube closer together
3. Once they are nearly touching, seat the M4 Hex nut into the nut holder of the handle and slide the handle over the bottom insert and acrylic tube. press the parts together slowly, pulling on the wire as necessary so it doesn't bunch up on the inside next to PCB2
4. Once the two parts are seated together, put the D-Ring in its place and screw the M4 x 55mm bolt back through the D-Ring, and then screw all the way in until it's just starting to get tight. Back off a few turns so it's not engaged at all.
5. Now put a small amount of the locktight/threadlocker on one of the M4 x 16mm screws and screw it most of the way down. repeat this step with the other 2 screws
6. Once all screws are in place, give a couple more turns to each to make sure the assembly is snug
7. Finally gently tighten the M4 x 55mm bolt. It just needs to engage a few threads as it's likely pretty well stuck in place by all the components it is going through. Overtightening could crack the acrylic tube.
8. Now assemble PCB3 and cut the 2 conductor wire coming out of the end of the handle to a length that is just barely protruding from the end. It will have to feed back into the handle once soldered to PCB3
9. Strip the ends of the wires and solder them into their place on the backside of PCB3
10. Secure PCB3 in place with the No6 x 1/4" thread cutting screws
