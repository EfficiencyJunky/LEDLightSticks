## 1. Acrylic Tube, Flat Bar and 3D Printed Inserts
### PARTS
1. 2" (50mm) outside diameter Acrylic Tube x 24"
2. Acrylic Tube Hole Placement Jig
3. 3D Printed top/bottom inserts
4. 2x -- 10-32 x 2-1/4" Philips Head Bolt
5. 2x -- 10-32 thin hex nuts
6. 1/2" x 1/8" Aluminum Flat bar at least 24" long
7. 2x -- D Rings
8. 3x -- M4 Thin Square Nut

### TOOLS
* **3/16" PlastiDrill Bit** for 10-32 Main Mounting Bolt Holes in Acrylic Tube
* **7/32" Regular Drill Bit** for hole in Flat Bar and D-rings
* **Phillips Screw Driver**
* **3/16" Regular Drill Bit (or smaller)** to mark flat bar hole location

### BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
1. Use the Acrylic Tube Hole Placement Jig to mark the hole placement on one side of the Acrylic Tube
2. Use the 3/16" PlastiDrill Bit to drill the holes
3. Place one of the 3D Printed inserts into the tube and make sure the 10-32 bolt goes all the way through
4. Measure 12mm from one end of the Flat Bar and make a mark
5. Use the 7/32" Regular Drill Bit to drill a hole in the middle of the flat bar at the 12mm mark
6. Place the 3D Printed insert back in the tube, and place the flat bar in the slot of the insert. Secure the insert and flat bar in place with the 10-32 bolt
7. Flip the Acrylic tube over and place the Tube Hole Jig on the other end of the tube. Make sure the Flat Bar slots into the opening in the center of the jig
8. Twist the jig slightly to make it so the flat bar doesn't jiggle if the tube is shaken. This will make the flat bar twist ever so slightly from one end of the tube to the other. This is necessary to prevent it from rattling.
9. Mark the hole placement on the acrylic tube and remove the jig but leave the flat bar inside
10. Use the 3/16" PlastiDrill Bit to drill the holes on this side of the tube
11. Now place the other 3D Printed insert into the tube and make sure the flat bar slots into the opening in the middle of it
12. Using a thin piece of metal with a sharp end (or the other 10-32 bolt), push the piece of metal through one of the holes in the acrylic tube and metal insert so that it presses against the flat bar. Rub it against the flat bar ake a mark on the
